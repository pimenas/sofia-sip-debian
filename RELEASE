==============================================
Release notes for current version of Sofia-SIP
==============================================

Changes since last release
--------------------------

Bugs in highlevel user-agent logic, scheduling of stack timers, 
and STUN client code have been fixed. Removed the SHA1 code derived
from RFC3174 due to licensing concerns.

API/ABI changes and versioning
------------------------------

libsofia-sip-ua:
- Added su_yield() function (sofia-sip/su_wait.h). See
  http://sofia-sip.sourceforge.net/refdocs/su/su__root_8c.html
- Added host_is_ip6_reference() (sofia-sip/hostdomain.h). See
  http://sofia-sip.sourceforge.net/refdocs/bnf/hostdomain_8h.html  
- Removed sofia-sip/sha1.h from the library. This removal is
  not considered as an API change, but instead a bugfix to 
  the 1.12.0 API/ABI. We know of no applications that are using 
  the sha1.h functionality, so applying this change as a bugfix
  was seen as an acceptable action. If however some application
  relying on sha1.h is found, please contact the sofia-sip team 
  and we will reconsider the issue. See sf.net bug #1525308 for 
  the whole history.
- This release is ABI/API compatible with applications 
  linked against 1.12.0. The ABI has been tested with the nua
  module unit test (test_nua) built against original 1.12.0 release.

libsofia-sip-ua-glib:
- No ABI/API changes, compatible with 1.12.0. Note, libsofia-sip-ua-glib
  interface is not considered stable and may change in a future 1.12.x
  release.
