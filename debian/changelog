sofia-sip (1.12.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Rémi Denis-Courmont ]
  * Added dependency to autotools-dev so that CDBS can update config.{guess,sub},
    and to libc headers
  * Fine-tuned libsofia-sip-ua-glib-dev dependencies.
  * Added '-z defs' linker flag to verify no undefined symbols go unnoticed.
  * Added '--as-needed' linker flag to remove extraneous .so's from list of
    needed libraries.

  [ Kai Vehmanen ]
  * Added libssl as a build dependency. Without this, some builds will
    have ssl disabled in the resulting packages.
