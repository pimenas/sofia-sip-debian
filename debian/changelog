sofia-sip (1.12.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Kai Vehmanen ]
  * Set DEB_* variables after including CDBS macros, not before.
  * The "--as-needed" linked option is now explicitly disabled (was
    enabled before, but didn't work as it was in the wrong place).
  * CDBS clean target was set to "clean". See
    http://www.bononia.it/~zack/blog/posts/2007/09/clean_distclean.html.
    (Closes: #442732)
  * Another fix related to #442732: remove the doxygen output directories
    in clean target. In upstream, the doxygen targets are not run
    by default, so also the cleaning has to be done separately.

sofia-sip (1.12.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Kai Vehmanen ]
  * New upstream release
    See the release notes at:
    http://www.mail-archive.com/sofia-sip-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg01286.html
  * Note that libsofia-sip-ua-glib ABI has changed, so libsofia-ua-glib3 replaces
    libsofia-sip-ua-glib0. This is not a major change however, as this library
    was not part of the stable set of interfaces, and no applications in Debian have
    yet used the -glib0 library.
  * Relaxed dependency from sofia-sip-bin to libsofia-sip-ua0 (allow newer versions
    of the library).

    Next upstream release will contain a renamed binary that can
    be added back to the package.

sofia-sip (1.12.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Rémi Denis-Courmont ]
  * Added dependency to autotools-dev so that CDBS can update config.{guess,sub},
    and to libc headers
  * Fine-tuned libsofia-sip-ua-glib-dev dependencies.
  * Added '-z defs' linker flag to verify no undefined symbols go unnoticed.
  * Added '--as-needed' linker flag to remove extraneous .so's from list of
    needed libraries.

  [ Kai Vehmanen ]
  * Added libssl as a build dependency. Without this, some builds will
    have ssl disabled in the resulting packages.

  [ George Danchev ]
  * Use new variables for binNMU-safety (as of dpkg-dev >= 1.13.19)

  * Added watch file and TODO.Debian
  * Adjusted maintainer and uploaders fields
  * Split-off a sofia-sip-doc package
  * Build-Depends on graphviz since /ust/bin/dot is needed at build time
