1) todo list for next upstream release (1.12.9-) 

   - none

2) generic concerns

   - it's normal that doxygen is run multiple times per library, but for
     some reason the debian build causes the top-level "doxygen" target
     to be run twice, and this needs to be fixed
     ref:http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-voip-maintainers/2006-November/006604.html
   
   - should we give some recommendations for embedded
     systems (like rm -rf /usr/share/doc) in README.Debian ?

3) pkg-config dependencies
 
   Should sofia-sip's pc file have separate lib and libs_piv sections
   in order to avoid creating dependencies between sofia-sip clients,
   and libraries on which libsofia-sip-ua depends?
