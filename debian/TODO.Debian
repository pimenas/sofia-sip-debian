1) todo list for next upstream release (1.12.5) 

   none

2) generic concerns

   should we give some recommendations for embedded
   systems (like rm -rf /usr/share/doc) in README.Debian ?

3) pkg-config dependencies
 
   Should sofia-sip's pc file have separate lib and libs_piv sections
   in order to avoid creating dependencies between sofia-sip clients,
   and libraries on which libsofia-sip-ua depends?
