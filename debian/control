Description: Sofia-SIP library utilities
 Sofia-SIP is an open-source SIP User-Agent library, compliant 
 with the IETF RFC3261 specification. It can be used as 
 a building block for SIP client software for uses such as VoIP, 
 IM, and many other real-time and person-to-person communication 
 services. 
 .
 This package provides a set of console tools and helper 
 applications for use in scripts, testing and other uses. All
 the tools utilize the Sofia-SIP library.

Description: Sofia-SIP library runtime
 Sofia-SIP is an open-source SIP User-Agent library, compliant 
 with the IETF RFC3261 specification. It can be used as 
 a building block for SIP client software for uses such as VoIP, 
 IM, and many other real-time and person-to-person communication 
 services. 
 . 
 The library is implemented in ANSI C, and provides an extensive
 set of features for implementing SIP/SIMPLE User-Agents. Highlights
 include full UDP/TCP/TLS support, IPv4/6 support, SIMPLE presence
 and messaging support, SIP offer/answer engine and numerous 
 mechanisms for NAT/FW traversal.
 .
 This package provides the main library runtime files.
